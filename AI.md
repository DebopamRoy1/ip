# AI-Assisted Development Log

## Tool Used: Gemini (Paid Tier)

### 1. Refactoring for Code Quality (A-CodeQuality)
* **Task:** Improving readability and adherence to SLAP.
* **How it helped:** The AI identified "arrowhead" code in the main response logic and suggested refactoring it into guard clauses and smaller helper methods (`executeCommand`).

### 2. Feature Extension (C-Update)
* **Task:** Implementing an 'update' command to edit existing tasks.
* **How it helped:** The AI suggested the `C-Update` extension as the most efficient "easiest" path and provided the logic for updating the `Task` model and `Parser` logic.

### 3. Add Increments (A-BetterGui)
* **Task:** Improving the GUI of Lebron.
* **How it helped:** The AI helped to change the UI of the chatbot accordingly, helping to add the background, dialog box text colours and circular images.
